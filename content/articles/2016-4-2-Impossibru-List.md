As [Joel Runyon](http://impossiblehq.com/impossible-list/) states in his blog, the impossible list is more like a collection of challenges rather than a bucket list, and it should contain the things you never thought that you’d be able to do. It is completely fine if you wanna reevaluate and alter your list later.
