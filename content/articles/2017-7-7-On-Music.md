Recently, a favorite band of mine named **“Blaue Blume”** have released their new single, called “Macabre”. (Go ahead and listen [my Blaue Blume playlist](http://open.spotify.com/user/taylandgn/playlist/5ew2sWU5vHdVMUSum2teYU)!)

And you know, you get **goosebumps and tears** (that would make a great band name btw) when you hear/see/experience something truly beautiful. Well.. that happens to me a lot when I listen to this great band from Denmark.

The thing is, they made me appreciate music a lot more. Also, isn’t it weird that among all those songs/albums released, we love only a very small subset of them? It’s like we all have some neural networks that are initialized with random weights and in the end **some songs make our neurons fire and some do not.**

And then I watched this old video from Vsauce **(It’s been 5 years wtf!?):**

Is the number of all possible songs uncountably infinite? Please go ahead and enlighten me about the countability of all the possible music we can produce/generate. In any case, the number of all the music scores we can compose is pretty big. Yet, we seem to be interested in only a really small subset. And maybe we can use this knowledge to create better compression algorithms? And yes, I do know that we get rid of less audible sounds and kinda **fine tune the audio signal for human ears.**

Also, are there any other life forms who appreciate sound waves? They may be totally unresponsive to them I guess.. **What do they do to wind down after a long day?** I think I will be long dead when we get answers to these questions and that sucks.

Hmppfssss.. whatever, go ahead and listen to this great band and have a great day! :)
