\***Reader:** ughh the obligatory 'I hate agile, it is useless' post again..\*

<!--more-->

Sooooo, it's been like a year and a half since I have started working in a professional working environment and I have yet to understand what story points stand for.

**"It's not about the time, it is about the effort!"** Yeah, I have been warned about this many times already. And as team members, we do not necessarily have to agree on the effort of a story either.

The other day I was trying to load 700k records from a database using a tool called datatables and ajax server-side processing. For the record, I am eager to learn new technologies but my learning curve is kinda pathetic. I am just a junior and I have been hired as a C++ developer. Whatever, I took the task with the hopes of learning something new..

\*_3 days later_\*

\*_Meanwhile, we put cute little dots on post-its.._\*

<div style="text-align:center" markdown="1">

<!-- *“It’s not about the time, it is about the effort!”* -->
</div>

**PM:** _“Sooo.. what have we done concerning this task?”_

**Me:** _“Well..erm.. I am done with loading the records, I have managed to fix that bug bla bla. But we can’t insert/delete/search yet. But the rest should be easier as I kinda understood how datatables works.”_

**PM:** _“\*not pleased\* hmm.. ok, but we need to finish and deploy it asap. **It is a 5-point task**, can you add insertion/deletion mechanisms today?”…._
<br><br>

Then he begins to creep on my screen every now and then..

I’m sorry, wut? – \_ –

OK, I get it the team gave that task 5 points in the meeting, and I respect that ofc. But instead of a much more experienced team member, if I take that task, it will naturally take much more **TIME & EFFORT**. Considering every one of us is a unique being, what is the point of story points? Is it merely a tool for managers?
