**Here are some of the things I want to accomplish in 2018:**

- GET YOUR MASTER'S DEGREE!
- Build a prototype of Kogo project and integrate it into your life.
- IoT stuff! Do some DIY or something and just learn that shit.
- Get better at drawing, and try getting into oil painting.
- Learn at least 4 skateboard tricks.
- Read at least 8 books. [Mass Effect Retribution, Elon Musk Bio, The Alchemist, ..]
- Draw 3-4 web comics and post them on this blog.
- Implement a neural network from scratch.
- Do at least 4 DIY projects.

"Happy fucking new year."
